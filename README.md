## Algorithm

This project uses Google Cloud Platform as the backend to store data securely including user data, futhermore it can be incorporated to do more like crash analytics, analsis, firebase push notification and so much more

This projects aims at prioritising good and attractive user design and experience while maintaining the algorithm that enables users to enroll into various courses.

Furthermore, there are much features to be included aswell as various APIs intgration like: Paypal, Stripe, AI, and so much more.

My algorithm enables a user to access courses when the enroll button is pressed, this takes up the user id and adds it to a special collection in firebase thereby enabling users in that collection to access enrolled courses simply by matching the various user id then linking themm to .collection('the specified course').

The project enables admin to access all active courses thereby having the authorisation to upload courses. For now I did not go in further due to contract not signed.

This project is just a little glance of what i can do, when offered the contract I will bring it to life 100%.
